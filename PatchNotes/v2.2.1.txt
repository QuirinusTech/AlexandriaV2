RESOLVED:
 - Styling update: .adminTableTr>td>details[open] position => fixed. ✔️

 ONGOING TESTING:
 - In WorkflowItemManager > MediaDetails; rearranged Media Info by category ❓
 - Bulk mode still janky with when some items are marked as postponed and others as downloading / done.❓
 - When there are episodes marked in different statuses (e.g. 'postponed' and 'new') fix ticket AND/OR notification creation to merge these so that the notification doesn't create duplicate/erroneous entries.❓
 - Notification replacement conditions need to be refined to allow for multiple notifications to be created for single entries. change notification id generation and update the method currently commented out

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - notification popup resets state when it vanishes.
 - No episode-specific release dates

 FUTURE FEATURES:
 // user email updates subscription option

 // dark mode toggle switch
 // user preferences page
 // localisations & translation
 // Admin Page mobile version
 // Entry history / changelog (i.e. requested on date, status changed to downloading on date, error reported on date)
