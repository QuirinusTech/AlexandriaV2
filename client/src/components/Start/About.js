      <p>
          The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world.

      <h3>This site</h3>
      <p>In 2020, an aspiring crepologist by the name of Matthew Gird decided to get his shit together and get a real job.</p>
      <p>In his search for meaning to learn something pursuing a meaning in life, he started learning web development.</p>
      <p>As a small-scale starter project, he sought to create Alexandria: a media center where users could request media.</p>
      <p>This site was the creator's first foray into the realm of back-end development in Python using the Flask framework.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Later he would find out that it was both more fun and significantly more painful to do this in React instead, so, in early April 2021 he started to do just that and rewrote the server in NodeJS.</p>
      <p>It would be months before Alexandria V2 would finally launch later that year in October.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Alexandria V2 has been an ongoing cycle of iteration, improvement, fiddling, review, critique and refactoring: It represents the culmination of years of learning, countless hours of work and over 50'000 lines of code.</p>
