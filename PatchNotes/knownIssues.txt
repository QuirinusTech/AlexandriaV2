KNOWN ISSUES:
 - no sorting for Message CMS table
 - Ticket splitting doesn't work for wfComplete (does work for wfNew) (provisionally resolved)
 - Multiple messages for the same entry aren't overriding each other if the epArray isn't identical. (introduce intelligent parsing of episode detail arrays)
 - Some functions in the OptionsWidget (e.g. deleting episodes) can cause the page to crash
 - lastEpisodeAirDate is actually the NEXT episode air date. Either update the name, or load both.
 - Popup messages can still be a bit janky with state conflict.
