CURRENT ISSUES:
// Adminwishlist
 - Episode List and Media Info popups should be centered modals rather than popping up on location.
// dataSetup on init
 - database isn't loaded until user manually clicks on Refresh.
 - Some text on the Admin Page is still in German

FUTURE FEATURES:
 // user email updates subscription option
 // Qbittorrent log parsing
 // dark mode toggle switch
 // user preferences page
 // localisations & translation
 // Admin Page mobile version
 // Entry history / changelog (i.e. requested on date, status changed to downloading on date, error reported on date)
